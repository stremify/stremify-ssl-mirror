# Stremify SSL Proxy
This is a proxy addon for Stremify that is meant to be ran on [PimpMyStremio](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio/tree/master). It takes advantage of PimpMyStremio's SSL mirror feature and allows you to use it with the Stremify addon so that you can access Stremify from a browser or similar environment without exposing your instance to the web.

In order to get started you will need to download this repo, either via``git clone stremify/stremify-ssl-proxy`` or by downloading it as a zip from the GitHub site.

After that is done extract it if needed and install [PimpMyStremio](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio/tree/master), if you have not already, after that move the entire folder with the addon files to one of the following directories, depending on what platform you are on:

- OSX: `~/Library/Preferences/PimpMyStremio/sideload/`
- Win: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\PimpMyStremio\sideload\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/PimpMyStremio/sideload/`

Once that is done, you can run PimpMyStremio and the addon will automatically start and appear under the "Sideloaded" tab. From there you can configure the host URL of your Stremify instance as well as install the plugin or get it's link.

Happy watching!
